\title{Approximation of standard errors of coefficients from small to large sample using the √2 rule}
\usage{
ApproxSERoot2(model_spatial)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_spatial}{Spatial model object to analyse.}
}
\value{
\code{ApproxSERoot2()} returns a matrix of approximate standard errors for given variables and dataset sizes, and a linear graph
to graphically illustrate these relationships.
}
\description{
The function approximates the standard errors of the coefficients of any econometric model on n observations to hypothetical values
for other sample sizes: n\*2, n\*4, n\*8, n\*16, n\*32 observations.
}
\details{
Approximating the standard errors of the coefficients is important when using bootstrap regression, e.g. \code{\link[=BootSpatReg]{BootSpatReg()}}, which by default
estimates the model on a smaller dataset and by nature yields higher standard errors of the coefficients. According to Kopczewska (2023),
standard errors of coefficients, especially in spatial econometric models, follow the √2 rule - the standard error in a model on a sample
twice as large is √2 as small.

This function applies to hypothetical dataset sizes that are doubled n\*2, n\*4, n\*8, n\*16, n\*32. Errors for these dataset sizes
are calculated as: er/(2^0.5)^1, er/(2^0.5)^2, er/(2^0.5)^3, er/(2^0.5)^4, er/(2^0.5)^5, where er is the standard error
from an original model for n observations.
